👋 Hi, I’m @loruuh

🎯 **Current Goal: Evolving from Coder to Strategic System Architect.**

👀 I’m interested in designing **highly scalable, robust systems** built on **Cloud-Native** principles. My focus is on **MLOps** (Machine Learning Operations) and **Data Engineering** to create intelligent, reliable applications.

🌱 **Current Learning Focus (Hard Skills):**
* **Python:** Deep dive into **Data Science, Pandas** and mastering **Clean Code** (TDD/Unit Testing).
* **Go (Golang):** Building high-performance **Microservices** and APIs.
* **Cloud-Native:** Practical mastery of **Docker and Kubernetes** in conjunction with a major cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure).

💡 **Methodology Focus (Soft Skills):**
* **System Design:** Learning the principles for engineering complex, maintainable architectures.
* **Code Quality:** Consistent application of **Clean Code** principles and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **Open-Source projects** that provide real value and challenge me to write production-grade code.

📫 How to reach me: just through GitHub directly.

😄 Pronouns: he (a determined architect)

⚡ Fun fact: I hate losing, which drives me to write **fault-tolerant code**.
